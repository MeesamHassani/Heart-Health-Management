# Heart-Health-Management

Application: React Native,
Back-End: Python and Firebase

This project aims at providing a solution to one of the major problems that is prevalent in world that is providing assistance to people suffering from cardiovascular diseases by using heart rate data gathered from MI bands and patient medical history data.

In this project I manage 1100 patientsâ€™ data. The data contain 13 attributes for each patient, for which I had to initially remove data redundancy and then classify that data into two parts, training and testing data. Then I use that data to train and test our machine learning modal (SVM).
